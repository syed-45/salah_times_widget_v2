# Salah Times Widget v2
This widget displays daily salah (prayer) times for Muslims. It contains the timetable for Newcastle Muslim Centre's annual prayer times and calculates the next prayer time based on the current time. This allows users to easily view the current and upcoming prayer times at any given moment. The widget is a useful tool for Muslims to plan their daily prayer schedule and ensure they do not miss any salah.
